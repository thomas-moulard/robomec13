abstract = {We propose a generalized framework together with an
                  algorithm to plan a discrete sequence of
                  multi-contact stances that brings a set of
                  collaborating robots and manipulated objects from a
                  specified initial configuration to a desired goal
                  through non-gaited acyclic contacts with their
                  environment or among each other. The broad range of
                  applications of this generic algorithm includes
                  legged locomotion planning, whole-body manipulation
                  planning, dexterous manipulation planning, as well
                  as any multi-contact-based motion planning problem
                  that might combine several of these sub-problems. We
                  demonstrate the versatility of our planner through
                  example scenarios taken from the aforementioned
                  classes of problems in virtual environments.},

abstract={ A development of humanoid robot HRP-2 is presented in this paper. HRP-2 is a humanoid robotics platform, which we developed in phase two of HRP. HRP was a humanoid robotics project, which had run by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with uneven surface, can walk at two third level of human speed, and can walk on a narrow path. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robot's own self if HRP-2 tips over safely. In this paper, the appearance design, the mechanisms, the electrical systems, specifications, and features upgraded from its prototype are also introduced.},
