robotics. However tackling optimization problems properly requires the
use of non-trivial algorithms whose tuning is challenging. RobOptim
aims at providing a unified framework for different categories of

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past years, numerical optimization proved
itself particulaly suited for various robotics applications such as
posture or trajectory optimization~\cite{miossec06,saab-tro-12}, robot
control~\cite{mansard-icra-12} and more. These applications yield both
linear and non-linear optimization problems with equalities and
inequalities constraints. Robot control also relies on other types of
optimization such as quadratic programming. As robot control
algorithms run in real-time, it leads to strong constraints on the
implementation efficiency. The design and implementation of a solver
is tedious and error-prone. Avoiding numerical precision issues,
ensuring that the algorithm behaves properly in all cases even with
ill-conditioned problems is challenging, in particular for roboticists
who are not necesseraly experts in optimization techniques. Among
available optimization toolboxes, the Matlab Optimization
Toolbox~\cite{matlab}, the Open Optimization library, OPT++,
IPOPT~\cite{ipopt}, SciPy~\cite{scipy} and the GSL (Gnu Scientific
Library)~\cite{gsl} all provides several optimization
algorithms. Unfortunately, these libraries suffer from several
drawbacks: some are difficult to use, some do no provide support for
advanced algorithms such as support for constrained optimization or
have efficiency issues, etc. They also all lack a unified model
expressing optimization problems.


RobOptim solves these limitations by introducing a framework to model
any continuous optimization problem, constrained or not. The design is
focused on providing a easy-to-use C++ set of safe and efficient
libraries which can be used to prototype robotics applications.  Let
us emphasize here that our framework does not implement any numerical
optimization algorithm. Instead, it provides a model for functions,
problems and solvers on the one hand and plug-ins wrapping existing
solvers as CFSQP or IPOPT on the other hand.  The RobOptim
computational model will be first introduced in~\autoref{sec:roboptim}
and different applications will be detailed
in~\autoref{sec:application}. In particular, an extension of RobOptim
for a particular category of problem has been implemented recently,
demonstrating the ability of RobOptim to support a large variety of
problems. The conclusion will detail advantages and limitations of the
current approach and summarize the roadmap for the next developments.

\section{RobOptim overview}\label{sec:roboptim}


RobOptim is a set of open-source C++ libraries avail\-able under the
LGPL license. Source code, documenta\-tion and examples are provided by
the project webpage: \mbox{\url{http://www.roboptim.net/}}.


\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{roboptim-architecture.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{RobOptim three layers architecture: solver (embedding
    existing state of the Art algorithms), core and
    applications.}\label{fig:layers}
\end{figure}


The RobOptim framework is divided into three parts: the solver, core
and application layers~\autoref{fig:layers}. The core layer provides a
computational model expressive enough to formulate different types of
optimization problems. The solver layer gathers various optimization
algorithms. The application layer consists in several
application-dependent packages bundling reusable mathematical
functions.


\subsection{Mathematical function representation}


Continuous optimization problems can be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:optimization}
  \min_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(\mathbf{x}) \text{ under the constraint } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{X}
\end{equation}

where $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the cost function
and $\mathbf{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is the subspace of the
admissible solutions. This space is usually defined by a set of
inequality and equality constraints:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{X} \triangleq \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    c_i (x) = 0    & \quad i \in \xi \\
    c_j (x) \leq 0 & \quad j \in \nu \\
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

$c_i : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $c_j : \mathbb{R}^n
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are respectively the set of equality and
inequality constraints. $i$ and $j$ are the indices identifying the
constraints.

The mathematical functions $f$ and $c_k$ ($k \in \xi \cup \nu$) must
provide a way to evaluate their result at any point they are
defined. Their associated gradient and hessian can also be
provided. Finally, each of these function may be categorized as
belonging to a set of functions matching a particular structure which
may help the resolution. One example is linear functions. The goal of
the RobOptim core layer is to express these features through the C++
typing rules.


Depending on the solving algorithm, it may be necessary to obtain the
Jacobian and in some cases even the functions Hessian. Hence,
functions providing maximum information about themselves will be
compatible with a larger proportion of solvers.


In RobOptim, each mathematical function is represented by a different
C++ class. All of these types then inherit the abstract kind of
mathematical functions they represent. The following kind of
mathematical functions are bundled with RobOptim core: function that
can evaluate itself (\texttt{Function} type), function that can
evaluate itself and its gradient (\texttt{DifferentiableFunction}),
function that can evaluate itself, its gradient and its hessian
(\texttt{TwiceDifferentiableFunction}), etc.  Let 'A <: B' be the
relationship ``type B is a subtype (subclass) of A'' or ``B inherits
from A''. Then a partial order can be defined where:
\texttt{Function} <: \texttt{DifferentiableFunction} <: \texttt{TwiceDifferentiableFunction}.


\subsection{Optimization problem definition and problem resolution}


Once the cost function and all constraint functions have been
implemented, an optimization problem has to be built. RobOptim core
provides a meta-class \texttt{Problem} parametrized by two parameters
$F$ and $C_L$. $F$ the cost function type and $C_L$ is the list of the
constraints types. A non-linear problem with constraints then has the
following type:


\texttt{Problem<DerivableFunction, vector<LinearFunction, DerivableFunction > >}


The constraints can be either linear or non-linear. With this type
definition, the constraints will be divided into two categories which
will help the solver perform efficiently.

Additionally, bounds can be set on the optimization variables and a
starting point for the optimization process may be specified. When the
constraints are added to the problem, each one of them is associated
with a validity interval. If this interval is reduced to a point, the
constraint is an equality constraint. At both compile time and
run-time, RobOptim checks that only valid problems are built. For
instance if one adds a linear constraint then RobOptim checks at
compile time that the constraint is a subtype of the
$\texttt{LinearFunction}$ type.


A solver that will solve the problem needs to be instantiated. Each
solver is parametrized by the same types as optimization
problems. Therefore the solver $S<P_1,C_{L1}>$ can solve the problem
$P<P_2,C_{L2}>$ if the following relation is true:


\begin{equation}
  P_1 <: P_2 \wedge \forall i, C_{L1}(i) <: C_{L2}(i)
\end{equation}


Basically, the problem can be solved if all types provide enough or
more information than necessary. For instance if gradients are
required, the function may also provide hessian computation but if
gradient is lacking the compile time assertions will fail and prevent
the user from building an invalid optimization problem.

By separating problem expression from solver, dynamic changes of the
solving algorithm are possible. Each solver is bundled as a plug-in
which is loaded at run-time. The interest is to let the user freely
change the problem complexity during the design process. Other
frameworks would require a different API depending on the kind of
optimization at hand, where through RobOptim changes are minimal. One
may choose to use a more powerful solver than required at first and
then refine the choice or implement later a new plug-in providing the
best algorithm for one particular application. These features are
provided through meta-programming techniques and come with a near zero
cost\footnote{RobOptim core does not realize copy so the additional
  runtime cost is only due to calls to virtual functions.} at runtime
and are unique to RobOptim.

\subsection{Cost and constraint toolbox}


Unlike others frameworks where computations are tightly linked to one
problem and one solver, RobOptim abstraction mechanism allows user to
implement toolboxes of reusable functions. This part of RobOptim is
dedicated to robotics. The ``trajectory'' toolbox from the RobOptim
application layer is currently providing trajectores defined as
B-Splines and associated mathematical functions to realize minimal
time optimization for instance.


\subsection{Toward easy and safe problem design}


RobOptim is heavily relying on templated meta-programming, a C++
language feature allowing in particular to define parametrized types
and execute algorithms at compile time~\cite{iso14882}. By defining
problems and solvers through parametrized types, the compiler is able
to check that the functions used to instantiate the optimization
problem are compatible with the type of problem under
construction. Thus, only solvers supporting this kind of problem can
be used. Through meta-programming, these safety checks are evaluated
at compile-time and thus do not impact final performances. Regarding
ease of use, having a unified representation of all models which
matches closely the underlying theory simplifies the understanding of
the implementation process.  Finally, RobOptim relies on modern tools
such as Boost and Eigen to support natural ways of implementing
algebra computation. Additional tools such as gradient checks through
finite differentiation is also provided to help ensuring functions
correctness.


\section{Applications and case study}\label{sec:application}


RobOptim has been used to solve several different types of robotics
problems. The two scenarii that will be detailed here are footsteps
optimization and posture optimization for a humanoid robot. Another
important point is the extensibility of the framework. To demonstrate
RobOptim capacities to adapt to new types of problems an example of
such extension will be given. These experiments aim at generating
motion for the humanoid robot HRP-2~\cite{hrp2}.


\subsection{Step planning for humanoid robots}


Generating a walking motion in an environment cluttered with obstacles
is challenging. One commonly used approach is the Rapidly-exploring
Random Trees (RRT) method applied to the robot bounding box or to the
robot itself sliding on the ground~\cite{dalibard2011small}.  This
probabilistic algorithm will try to create a path between the starting
point and the goal point by sampling configurations randomly and is
able to find solutions for highly dimensioned problems on a reasonable
time. However, the probabilistic nature of these algorithms leads to
paths which seem unnatural. One solution to improve these paths is
numerical optimization. In this application, RobOptim has been used to
optimize a biped robot walking trajectory determined beforehand by a
motion planning algorithm.

Let $\gamma$ be the initial robot waist trajectory defined as a
B-Spline from $t_{min}$ to $t_{max}$. A free time trajectory $\Gamma$
is defined from $T_{min}$ to \linebreak $T_{max} = T_{min} + \lambda
(t_{max} - t_{min})$ as
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{\lambda} (T) = \gamma (t_{min} + \frac{1}{\lambda} (T -
  T_{min}))
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|l l l| l |l l l|}
      \hline
      Time
      & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{control point 1}
      & \ldots
      & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{control point $n$}\\
      \hline
      $\lambda$
      & $x_0$ & $y_0$ & $\theta_0$
      & \ldots
      & $x_n$ & $y_n$ & $\theta_n$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Optimization variables for walking motion problem\label{fig:optim-param}}
\end{table}


The use of a free time trajectory allows the solver to optimize both
trajectory shape and speed by respectively changing the control points
and the scale $\lambda$. Optimization variables are illustrated
by~\autoref{fig:optim-param}. The free time trajectory derived from
the trajectory $\gamma$ is used as the state of the solver.


\begin{table}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline Cost function & $f(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda$\\ Speed
      constraint & $\forall T, \text{foot},\quad
      (\frac{v_{\text{foot}}^{x}}{v_{\text{max}}^{x}})^2 +
      (\frac{v_{\text{foot}}^{y}}{v_{\text{max}}^{y}})^2 - 1 \leq
      0$\\ Distance constraint & $\forall T,\quad\text{distance} (\text{obstacle},
      \Gamma (T)) > 0$\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Walking optimization problem formulation\label{fig:pb-walking}}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


The problem cost function is defined as $\lambda$. It corresponds to
minimizing the time by accelerating the trajectory as much as
possible. To preserve a feasible final trajectory while encouraging
forward motion, a speed constraint is added which takes separately
into account the front speed $v^x$ and the lateral speed $v^y$ of each
foot of the robot. Another constraint is preventing the robot from
colliding with obstacles. The problem definition is detailed
in~\autoref{fig:pb-walking}.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hrp2-two-chairs.png}
    \caption{Walking trajectory optimization\label{fig:result-walking}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


This non-linear problem has been successfully solved by RobOptim while
relying on the proprietary solver CFSQP~\cite{cfsqp} internally and
result is shown on~\autoref{fig:result-walking}.


\subsection{Posture optimization for humanoid robots}


Another problem is posture optimization, which consists in choosing
the best configuration such that a system will accomplish the
objectives it has been assigned
(see~\ref{fig:stence-optimization}). In this example, the goal is to
find a configuration as close as possible to a goal posture while
taking into account various constraints. In this case, robots and
environment objects are considered as elements of the optimization
problem. Constraints include: robot and objects static equilibrium,
Newton's third law, Coulomb friction model, fixed grasp model for
bilateral contact forces, joint limits, torque limits and FEM-modeled
deformation of the environment~\cite{Bouyarmane2011b}. This problem is
described extensively in~\cite{Bouyarmane2011a,Bouyarmane2010} and
demonstrated the ability of RobOptim to solve complex large scale
non-linear problems.


\subsection{Extending the framework: least square optimization}


Initially, non-linear optimization problems with constraints have been
solved with RobOptim. By providing a generic computational framework,
it is possible to extend RobOptim to support other types of problems
such as least square optimization. A least square optimization problem
is an unconstrained problem, the cost function of which is defined by

\begin{equation}
  f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^m f_i (\mathbf{x})^2
\end{equation}
where $f_1,\cdots,f_m$ are $m$ non-linear differentiable functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

To build functions matching this definition, another function type
called \texttt{SumOfC1Squares} has been derived from the
\texttt{DifferentiableFunction} class. The constructor of this new type takes
as input the function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ the coordinates of
which are $f_1,\cdots,f_m$. \texttt{SumOfC1Squares} then redefines evaluation
and gradient of $\sum_{i=1}^m f_i (\mathbf{x})^2$.

The CMinPack solver has then
been wrapped into a RobOptim solver class which takes as input problem
of the type: \texttt{Problem<SumOfC1Squares, vector<> >}.

The introduction of this new type of solver did not require any change
in the RobOptim infrastructure and proved the genericity of the
approach.


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}


A new approach to optimization problem representation has been exposed
in this paper. By expressing numerical optimization problems through
C++ typing, the RobOptim optimization framework provides a unified
computational model. Moreover, advanced C++ template meta-programming
techniques preserve efficiency while giving the capacity to express
high-level mathematical objects such as cost functions and
constraints. These features proved useful to solve different types of
robotics problems.

However though being generic, the RobOptim core layer suffers from
limitations. It still lacks support for optimization in non-scalar
spaces such as $\text{SO}(3)$. By importing knowledge about the
structure of the optimization variables, solvers could realize more
efficient computations. For instance, \mbox{3D} rotations can be
represented by homogeneous matrices, quaternions, vectors and angles,
etc. Switching from one representation to another may lead to better
convergence and a decrease in the number of necessary mathematical
operations. One goal would be to both be able to express information
regarding the optimization variables structure and to find a method to
help solvers rely on these additional information. To achieve this
level of expressiveness, modern C++ features are of great help and no
optimization framework is providing yet such features when it comes to
design an optimization problem.


Therefore, RobOptim is a step forward toward making optimization
techniques available for non-expert by providing easy-to-understand
and generic model, strong C++ object model ensuring safety and
toolboxes bundling robotics oriented functions that may be reused when
one builds its own optimization problem.
